- Descriptive Statistics
- Visualizations (Boxplots, Histograms, etc.)
- Factor-based analysis (e.g., severity by age group, area, etc.)

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the notebook using Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Task_5.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells sequentially to view the analysis.

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure `RTA Dataset.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
